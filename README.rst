Easily create films of 1D and 2D python arrays.

Getting Started
===============

Python version support
----------------------

*pyfilm* supports Python 3.6-3.9.

Installation
------------

*pyfilm* can be installed directly from `pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyfilm

This should install all the required dependencies. If `numpy` doesn't get
automatically installed, install it first using `pip` and try again.

System dependencies
-------------------

*pyfilm* generates a .png file for each timestep and stitches them together
using ffmpeg/avconv. The following non-system specific packages are therefore
required:

* libpng_
* libav_ or ffmpeg_

For example on Ubuntu 14.04 these are installed via:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libav-tools

For OSX using the Brew package manager, these can be installed via:

.. code:: bash

    brew install libpng ffmpeg

*pyfilm* will automatically check which of these is installed on your system
and default to ``avconv`` if both are found.

Refer to the known issues section in the documentation_ to deal with Matplotlib
backends in case plots don't display.

.. _libpng: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
.. _libav: https://libav.org/
.. _ffmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org/
.. _documentation: http://pyfilm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Python dependencies
-------------------

*pyfilm* requires:

* numpy_
* matplotlib_
* pillow_
* py-cpuinfo_

.. _numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/
.. _pillow: https://python-pillow.github.io/
.. _py-cpuinfo: https://github.com/workhorsy/py-cpuinfo

A complete list is found in the requirements.txt file and is installed by
running:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Since this project is structured as a PIP package, it also needs to be installed
using the following command (in the package root directory):

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

Importing
---------

Simply import into your project via:

.. code:: bash

    import pyfilm as pf

Examples
--------

1D Example: *pyfilm* expects y to be of the form *y(t, x)*

.. code:: bash

    import numpy as np

    x = np.random.rand(10)
    y = np.random.rand(10, 10)
    pf.make_film_1d(x, y)

2D Example: *pyfilm* expects z to be of the form *z(t, x, y)*

.. code:: bash

    import numpy as np

    x = np.random.rand(10)
    y = np.random.rand(10)
    z = np.random.rand(10, 10, 10)
    pf.make_film_2d(x, y, z)

1D Example with styling and options:

.. code:: bash

    import numpy as np

    x = np.random.rand(10)
    y = np.random.rand(10, 10)
    pf.make_film_1d(x, y, plot_options={'lw':3, 'ls':'--'},
                    options={'ylabel':'Amplitude', 'fname':'amp'})

Running Tests
-------------

*pyfilm* uses the pytest framework for unit and functional tests. To
run the tests, run the following in the package root directory:

.. code:: bash

    $ py.test

To see information on the test coverage for individual files:

.. code:: bash

    $ py.test --cov pyfilm tests

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is completely built on Sphinx with numpydoc_ docstring
convention and is hosted on `Read the Docs`_. Using
RTD/GitHub webhooks, the documentation is rebuilt upon every commit that makes
changes to the documentation files The current build status is shown by the
``docs`` badge at the top of the main page. To make the docs, run:

.. _numpydoc: https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc
.. _`Read the Docs`: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyfilm/

.. code:: bash

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

where ``html`` can be replaced with other acceptable formats, such as latex,
latexpdf, text, etc. In order to view the Latex document, it first has to be
built:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd build/latex
   $ make
